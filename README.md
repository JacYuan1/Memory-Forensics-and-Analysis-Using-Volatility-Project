<h2 id="#Introduction">Introduction</h2>

The premise of this project is to perform memory forensics and analysis using Volatility. The final report will be linked in the [References section](#References). This will be done through **Linux** as the SIFT Workstation already comes with Volatility pre-installed.

<h2 id="#Tools-Used">Tools Used</h2>

The tools used here are the following:

1. [SIFT Workstation](https://www.sans.org/tools/sift-workstation/)
2. [FTKÂ® Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-imager)
3. [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
4. Windows 10 ISO

<h2 id="#Approach-to-Problem">Approach to Problem</h2>

1. Solved the problem set with the commands that are offered within Volatility.
2. To create a dump file, I used FTK imager for memory collection. 

<h2 id="#Learning-Outcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2>

1. Learned how to use Volatility commandlets that can manipulate Image Identification, Processes Listings, Process Information, PE File Extraction, Code Injection, Logs/Histories, Network Information, Kernel Memory/Objects, Timelines, Volshell, Dump Conversion, API Hookings, YARA Scanning, File System Resources, GUI Memory, Disk Encryption, Password Recovery and Strings.
2. Learned how to use FTK imager for memory collection.
